# GuardRails

GuardRails is a forked version of Handlebars.js with the primary goal of supporting two-way data binding. This extension provides additional functionality while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of Handlebars.

## Introduction

Handlebars.js is a popular templating engine known for its simplicity and power. However, it lacks built-in support for two-way data binding, which is essential for many modern web applications. GuardRails aims to bridge this gap by incorporating two-way binding capabilities into Handlebars, making it more versatile for dynamic applications.

## Features

- **Two-Way Data Binding:** Automatically sync data between the model and the view, enabling more interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Enhanced Functionality:** Additional helper functions and features to extend the core capabilities of Handlebars.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintains compatibility with existing Handlebars templates, allowing for a seamless transition.
